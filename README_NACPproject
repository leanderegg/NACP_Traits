############ README File fore NACP analysis Project ###########
Initiated 03/22/16 by LDLA


Observations to date:

### About Traits:
1) SLA_HSA much better than SLA_PSA (way fewer NAs)
2) only real traits I can analyze are SLA_HSA, LEAF_CN, and LEAF_LIFE
--->>> Also looks like total LEAF_C and total LEAF_N are worth analyzing!!! (maybe ask Bev and Logan about this??) - they both decrease with leaf lifespan across species.
3) on average, a little under 3 measurements per plot.
4) I can get TONS of SLA from TRY, not very many C/N and even fewer Leaf Lifespan traits.
5) JunOcc doesn't have LEAF_LIFE because scales...
  - Arbutus.menziesii & Calocedrus.decurrens also lack leaf lifespan info. 

### About Species:
1) 12 species with >20 records, but Purshia tridentata (tridentate in the data) was only measured at 2 sites, so removed it for a final of 11 species

This leaves me with 4 firs, 3 pines, and 4 random conifers.


## UPDATE 3/22/16 : it seems like dropping the requirement down to >10 measurements (not HUGE, but maybe worth?) keeps in an additional pine & an additional fir, so I'm moving to that instead.

16 SPECIES (after removal of Purshia tridentata)

## UPDATE 02/14/17 : it seems like dropping the requirement down to >5 measurements (not HUGE, but maybe worth?) keeps some broad leafed trees (total of 23) measured at multiple sites. Assuming that these are stand averages and not individual measurements, this seems reasonable to keep these extra 8 spp 



### About patterns:
1) a lot of (apparently) hump shaped relationships suggests combinations of climate variables interacting.
2) LEAF_LIFE and LEAF_CN might show more relationships than SLA
3) No traits show broadly consistent signs of relationships across all species, and some species show visible trends in one variable but rarely the same viarable across species.

*** 4) Trait relationships with each other:
- LEAF_LIFE & LEAF_CN seem to be related only in TSHE and ABGR
- LEAF_LIFE and SLA may be related in true firs and doug fir
- SLA & LEAF_CN: nothing obvious except maybe a negative relationship in TSHE
- LEAF_CARBON and LEAF_NITROGEN both show strong and consistent decreasing patterns with LEAF_LIFE. These do not show up in LEAF_CN
  --> however, there don't seem to be any CARBON or NITROGEN relationships with SLA, except maybe N w/ SLA in TSHE

SPECIFIC SPECIES:
Pseudotsuga menziesii - shows a strong interaction between PPT, T and SLA
  - positive in hot places and negative in cold places!!!!!
** This also holds true if we pool all species and analyze the entire traits.common data set with or without PSME!!!


*Some thing I probably need to worry about:
Some of these projects were selected for young and regenerating stands, and might have weird values for some stuff.
--For example: LEAF_CARBON shows a general decrease with AG_FGROWTH (above ground foliage growth), in the EPA project (where most LEAF_CARBON values come from that also have AG_GROWTH), but it shows a positive relationship for ORCA, which has 37 values...
--LEAF_CARBON wildly different between the four projects that collected Pinus ponderosa


***NOTE: COHO and EPA seem to have consistently higher LEAF_CARBON values for all species compared to ORCA and COHO. I probably need to use this as a fixed effect, since I don't actually have that many different projects

***NOTE: from Poorter, Lambers & Evans 2013 in New Phyt = LES is on per mass basis, but need to also consider per area basis?

### 11.07.16 ###
Throwing down a quick PCA to see how things fall out. Prob on PSME and second most represented tw spp?
## Climate PCs:
  # PC1 (72% of variance) - Water supply (ppt, soil moist). + = more water
  # PC2 (18% of variance) - Tave. + = warmer.
  # PC3 (7% of variance) - vpd. + = more evap demand

Lessons from quick pairplots of 5 most common species (PSME, TSHE, PIPO, ABIGRA, ABICON)
  - not really strong trait~climate relationships.
  - relationships vary quite a bit by species
  - the PCs aren't orthogonal for any particular species.
  - leaf Life seems to be one of the strongest trait-trait, trait-clim, and trait-growth relationships.
  - Growth and AGB typically pretty related, so prob need to standardize for AGB (OR BA?)


## played around with Leaf Mass : Stem Mass and SLA
# plus SLA and Growth vs RGR (growth/Biomass)
  -SLA shows no pattern with L:S biomass
  -SLA stays constant (many species) or increases (couple species + overall) with GROWTH
  -**BUT SLA DECREASES with either RGR or LnRGR in almost all species....
  ****** THIS IS COMPLICATED AND NEEDS MORE THOUGHT ******
  ** I should also probably only do this for stands that are dominanted by the species (mostly single species sites)


## as part of the NIRv stuff, I made community weighted traits using only plot values.
** only community weighted SLA and NITROGEN are related. LEAFLIFE is not 
** LEAF_LIFE and SLA increase with stand LAI_O, but NITROGEN shows not relationship
** SLA increases with production, NITRGEN might increase a smidge, no LEAF_LIFE difference



##### Notes on making Community Weighted Trait means ##########
- 265 plots total
- 222 have LAI_O, 226 have total NPP
- 221 have both LAI & NPP
- 141 have all traits and NPP in first pass dataset (somehow only 130 get passed through to biomass2)



##### 01.14.17 #####
cleaned (sort of) the soil csv. I'm still not sure if there's consistency in how plots with only 2 layers name the second layer, so just pulled the 'top' layer and added that to my traits data frame.
  # topsoil N generally increases with P, and increases with MAT at high P, and increases with topsoil depth at high P

  # most species have increased foliar N with increased soil N. Doesn't really matter if multiplied by topsoil depth.
  
OUTSOURCED: NIRv analysis to a code in that project directory
- ggplot helper functions to my R General Functions foulder and sourced it

added in some prelim plots to investigate how different traits are in the different projects. Def need a random intercept for LEAF_CARBON, but probably ok for other traits.


#01.15.17 ------ Leaf Economic Spectrum work -------------
grabbed the GLOPNET trait data from Wright et al. 2004

Tried to compare LES dataset and traits, but
  # LES: things are log10, not ln in this dataset!
  # LES: LMA is g/m2, and SLA in traits is cm2/gC
  # -> so to convert I have to recalculate SLA w/ leaf dry wt, then multiply by 1/100^2, then take 1/SLAnew
  # also turns out that many EPA don't report LEAF_DRY_WT or LEAF_HSA. so I'll have to back calculate it from SLA_HSA and %C

* Noticed that METOFIRE are missing LEAF_CARBON when I recalculate LMA as 1/(SLA_HSA * %C /100^2). (i.e. it yeilded 89 NAs, 1 EPA and all the METOFIRE, which have LMA normally)
  That's because METOFIRE has Carbon_wt but not the elemental analysis. 
SOOOOO, I can get some more %C by dividing METOFIRE LEAF_CARBON_WT by LEAF_DRY_WT


# leaf lifespan for many decid species in traits is pegged at 1 year. for deciduous species:
[1] "Purshia.tridentate"        "Alnus.rubra"           "Chrysolepis.chrysophylla"

[16] "Lithocarpus.densiflorus"   "Quercus.chrysolepis"  

### Leaf Lifespan = NA for 
1      Arbutus.menziesii
2    Cercocarpus.unknown
3 Juniperus.occidentalis
4         Pinus.flexilis


# It also looks like conifer LMA with HSA rather than PSA is lower than the conifers in the LES dataset.




######## 01.16.17 ######
started the beginnins of a baysian hierarchical model to 
1) model the mean intraspecific slope
2) model species mean trait values 
3) model the grand slope across species means (and maybe w/in genera? family?)

The first simple model was pretty simple, converged well, and passed model diagnostics. Doesn't look quite identical to the ML estimate, but reasonably close

####### 01.24.17
worked in importing the TRY traits
- had to remove some duplicates
- also had to change some unicode issues
All told (if things are working as I think), I've only got:
505 - LL & Nit
8587 - SLA & Nit
708 - SLA & LL
--> not huge.

In full dataset, 
2744 spp appear in the dataset >4 times
1294 spp appear in the dataset >10 times
572 spp appear >20 times
43 spp appear >43 times

##### 
I played around with TRY data, and they're very much not all in the same units.
- not sure it's even worth fucking around with this as much

# Instead, I worked on assigning the LES species to families
- used the {taxize} package to search itis and ncbi.
- this resulted in ~500 missing family values
- I also found genera with different families ascribed to them. Often this was a relic of old taxonomy, but sometimes it just straight screwed up.
  -after fixing the genera with multiple families, I only have 448 entries sans family
  ** I really should go through these and figure out what they are synanymns for, and fix them. But for the time being i'm forging forward
  
Plotted relationships at different taxonomic scales, and also created LES datasets averaged to different scales
  - things to think about: ~ 520 entries were duplicate species, so LESspp has 2021 rows.
  - I'm not sure whether it's more defensible to average log(trait) values, or to average raw trait values and log them. I did both in the LESspp, LESgen, LESfam datasets, and it doesn't really change the correlations, but it does move means upward in log(trait) space because mean(log(x)) < log(mean(x))
  - I also realied that I really need to be working with correlations rather than linear regressions, because major axix regression is what I'm looking for.
  - found some papers on this and other trait stuff (now in the LES folder), and papers about missing trait biases, imputation, etc. Shit gets complicated in a hurry. But I did find some code for Bayesian Correlation at: https://www.r-bloggers.com/bayesian-estimation-of-correlation-now-robust/
  
My new goal: build a hierarchical correlation analysis in JAGs
- got the model to reconstruct the negative correlation between lma and Nmass
- but haven't worked on the missing data issue. Need to read how to do that.
I got the bivariate relationship to work. But when I throw in 3 variables, I have major issues with the error:
Error: RUNTIME ERROR:
Cannot invert matrix: not positive definite

From snooping around the internet, I have concluded that the problem is that the uniform(-1,1) prior ends up with bivariate correlations that are too large and somehow that ends up with things not being positive definite. 
Depending on what I read on the internet, the solution might be to reparameterize this so I don't have to invert the covariance matrix, or maybe try different priors or something? 
I can also just restric my rho priors to [-.5,.5], and shit works, but the covariance estimate that I come up with is not quite like what I get from a cov(lma,Nmass,LL). all the correlations end up being right at the edge of my priors (-.494, .491, -.493). and my sigmas end up a bit off.  Not sure exactly what to do here, but it's fucking strange.
This seems almost relevant:
http://www.talkstats.com/showthread.php/52832-Trouble-specifying-correlation-matrix-in-rjags
main takehome seems to be that I can't have independant uniform priors unless I restrict them. But I'm not exactly sure how to specify an inverse wisheart





###### Data exploration that has arisen while reading LES stuff:
- the precip interaction with the LL vs LMA interaction found in Wright et al. 2002 shows the opposite trend in PSME. Only marginally significant MAP * LMA interaction, but visibly very impactful.
However, this doesn't really seem to play out all that consistently with other species. This is partly because other species don't show strong LL v LMA relationships. Partly because other species don't show strong LL MAP relationships.
  - seems consistent but not significant with PINPON, consistent ofset with TSUHET, consistent but not sig with ABIGRA, and consistent but no offset with ABICON
Saved a figure of this. In a hierarchical model, I'd bet that the main intercept and interaction terms are significant.

I'd say, if there is a trend, it's for dry to be higher LL than wet, for there to be a negative relationship between LL and LMA, and for this relationship to get slightly more negative with decreasing precip.


##### NEW COMMIT  3.14.17 ####### 

turns out, I hadn't committed in for ever. just did.
Recently, I:
- made some 'funnel plots' to make sure that spp SMA slopes weren't a function of sample size or variance
- this required adding a variance column to all of my outputs from fitMAR
- this revealed that I no longer get the same answer as I did the first time I created "Results_SimpleMAreg_v1_030817.csv"
- in trying to fix this, I stopped to add traits species means in to LES. created a couple duplicate species..
[1] "Abies.lasiocarpa"      "Arbutus.menziesii"     "Holodiscus.discolor"   "Picea.sitchensis"     
[5] "Pinus.flexilis"        "Pinus.jeffreyi"        "Pinus.ponderosa"       "Pseudotsuga.menziesii"
******Haven't dealt with that yet...**********
- But I did realize that in creating spp.data out of traits.common5 and LES, I was using LMA_PSA for traits.common5
- this lead to problems because many pines didn't have a PSA_to_HSA number, so were kicking out NAs
- I had to infill this number and recalculate. 

GOING to rm(list=ls()) this and try again. Wish me luck...



Notes from funnel plots:
Nmass vs LL - Rho looks same against both var(Nmass) and var(LL), and suggests it's just a variance thing



### variance decompostion in the PNW dataset:
Why is w/in spp variation smaller in Dominant Conifers that in all datasets?
  It looks like the problem is that raw trait values are VERY non-normal in the global dataset. So the variance estimates are probably pretty inaccurate.
*******  Not sure how to deal with this. NEED TO FIX..... **********



-I added a lot of environmental modeling code to do model selection for all spp in the PNW with decent replication.
I then made a couple nifty ways of visualizing this data and threw a fatty table in the manuscript.


##### NEW COMMIT  3.17.17 ####### 
I'm about to update all analyses to include species with 5, rather than 6 trait values. Currently, both PNW and globnet were reduced to <5, and I think I should use <=5 instead to really jack up my sample size.
  # doesn't really change anything all that much
  
- but I do still need to includ coffee in. This will make my plot look quite a bit more flushed out, but really won't change my conclusion that the slope is much steeper (MA slope = 1.03 for coffee and averages 1.13 for all intra-specifics)
* Note: arabidopsis doesn't seem to show this NEARLY as strongly...



- Variance Decompositions: 
I replotted the PNW variance decomp with green=ITV and purple = btw species var.
Couldn't really decide how to subset the dataset. I could either go for 
1) dominants - anything that comes up as a SPP_O1 in biomass
2) common conifers - things in the common conifer genera (e.g. no Juniperus)
3) things that dominate at least 2 plots - turns out this is actually the same as 1?
4) anything that could conceivabily be lumped into 'needle leafed conifer'




######## New Commit: 03.20.17 ##############
committing changes before outsourcing ML methods from the Bayesian Models code

- Outsourced ML methods to
Cd-TaxonomicAnalysis.R

- also outsourced some plotting to Fig-ManuscriptFigures

03.30.17
cleaned up and imported Tassie Euc data, Martin 2015 coffee data, my CO aspen data, and Bill's CO quga data
created suppdata, with everything averaged to the individual. saved this in /Intra data
about to commit everything, and then rerun all my variane decomps
If that works, I'll rerun my taxo analysis.
*** note: for adding these extra spp into var decomp, I probably need to exclude Project=="CO" for LL, because
these LLs come from AVHRR and are averaged to stand. So they might screw up the variance.



######## New Commit: 03.30.17 ##############
UPDATING Variance Decomposition!!!

- started by rm(list=ls()) the environment to make sure everything works clean.

I spent the day cleaning the taxonomy. jesus h christ. I got it down to only 47 entries with NA for family.
I also realized that I should have been saving the new species names for posterity when I matched them with 
the function tnrs() from Taxize. What I should probably do is write a function that takes the whole dataset, and then querries all names in chunks of 10 and saves the accepted name and genus in a new column. This function will take hours to run though.


####### New Commit: 04.02.17 ###################
After updating the datasets completely (taxonomic cleaning and unifying everything into one dataset for Variance Decomp, then allspp, allgen, allfam w/ all the means and gen.data, spp.data, etc for the within-taxon trait covariations. Trying to commit before I update the taxnomic analysis to have a global and then update my boxplots.


- things have been fully updated. Everything seems to look pretty good, and inferences were largely stable across versions.



*** Note: played around with the Maire dataset a little bit. It seems to have quite a few new samples. Some of these include maybe 10 more species with replication. This is useful for LMA and Narea/Nmass. But it doesn't have leaf lifespan in it... boo.


####### New Commit: 04.05.17 ###################
committed just for upkeeps sake.
- did some replotting, updating of plots and whatnot. 


###### New Commit: 04.07.17 #######################
realized that it is best to have either LMA & LL on the x or y axis for looking at Narea relations. I think it's most visually interpretable with LL and LMA on the x axis. Can't really tell what's going on with LMA on the y axis (figure dimensions make everything look like isometry. Which maybe it is?? but I don't think so give the boxplots)
Also, LL on the x axis really shows the poor global relationship between LL and Narea. it's very striking. So I'm updating all.results to show that.
- added a little code to fit.MAR so that x or y can be the variable screened for 0 variance 



04.15.17
Added in Nmass environmental modeling in Cd-Initial_Analysis.R
- I initially saved the VariableImportances as Apr instead of March. I updated the old file names in the code and in /Trait_models

* updated Trait-ClimateResults_worksheet.xlsx with Nmass
* updated Figure AvgModCoefficients_VariableImportances_boxplot_v2.pdf



05.15.17
Added Narea v LL statistical analysis in Cd-TaxonomicAnalysis, and to Table S4 in the appendix of the manuscript (version in the Dissertation folder for the moment, but not in the full dissertation document)
Adding stats for 


05.16.17
started coding up a null model for testing correlation degredation.
made a function that pulls the range of X and Y values for a taxon, then draws a bunch of random samples from a global distribution truncated around a box of the appropriate x and y range centered on a random point. I then calculate the lci and uci for each species based on the lower and upper quantiles from this random draw.

LMA vs Nmass - things work pretty well. Everything except 2 spp within the 95% confidence interval (2-tailed), and the two significant ones are stronger correlations than expected
  4 of 32 spp are more extreme than null, 3 of them are negative (Abies procera is more positive than expected)

LMA vs LL - things aren't quite as significant as I was hoping. 
  - 4 of 18 spp are more negative than the null at p<0.025 (one tailed/0.05 2 tailed)
  - 5 of 18 spp more negative at p<0.05 (one tailed)
  - 9 of 18 spp more negative at p<0.1 (one tailed)
Many, but not all of these, are the well sampled species. P contorta, P ponderosa, and T. heterophylla aren't significant though they're pretty well sampled...

LMA vs Narea - only 7 of 32 spp AREN'T more extreme than the null


My next step is to add this in to all.results in Taxonomic Analysis. But I'll commit first in case I break something


Ok, updated all LL vs Nmass references, so they are x=LL and y=Nmass (and referenced LL.N)
  - however, some of the axes may have changed. I will only know this after I update all.results.cl and try to replot everything...
  

Now adding in null model results.
- I expanded my null model function to calculate the 2.5,5,and 10% quantiles.

After many false starts, I think my function works appropriately, and I've now recreated all.results with
1) rerun LL vs Nmass ()




########## New Commit: 05.16.17
- about to add in null model estimates to all.results, also may swap Nmass axes so I can plot them both on the Y axis to mirror how I treat Narea
  - LMA vs Nmass, Nmass is on the Y (good!)


outsourced Community Weighted traits calculations to a new script. Decided to commit before I go further


########## New Commit: 06.14.17
-removed the community weighted calculations from Cd-Initial_Analysis.R
-removed the trait x Environment analyses (lots of plotting code and then final model averaging approach) from 
  Cd-Initial_Analysis.R to Cd-Trait-Environment-Analysis.R
-removed trait x Growth analyses and exported ot Cd-Trait_Growth_Analyses.R


+ added RGRdom90 and stGrowthdom90 to traits and traits.common to make a more restrictive cuttoff for single species growth analyses.
  I also figured out how RGR was initially filtered by RGRdom in traits, rather than in the creation of the stand average dataset from traits.common. This is not elegant, or parsimonious, but it works.
+ added RGR90 and stGrowth90 to the stand averages for more restrictive growth analysis.

Reran the Growth~Trait analysis with plotavs90, and results are nearly identical. significances are weaker, but R2 are almost identical.
 + updated the code and automated the R2 and p values for the Dom90 versions...


## notes from working on community-weighted trait averages:
Plot #s
801-820 : no trait data
10 : missing PSME traits (SPP_O1 w/ 37% of BA)
26 : no trait data (PINPON dominant)
45 : have PSEMEN traits (3), but missing PINCON
48 : missing ABIPRO but have Tsuga Het, Tsuga Mert, and PSEMEN
54 : missing THUPLI and PSME, but have TSUHET and ABIGRA
55 : no spp data
61-62 : no spp data
64 : missing PSEMEN (1) and TSUHET (3)
73 : no spp data
79 : no spp data
82 : Missing PSEMEN but have others
99 : no spp data (PINPON forest w/ no plot data)
312,313 : missing majority of SLA data
Metolius River : 901 - 976 - missing the majority of SLA data



+ added comparison between cwm SLA from spp averages and from actual plots. very similar trend with MAP. but spp means only explain ~57% of the variance of plot-specific cwms
+ made a new folder to hold these figures.
- changeing ..s monicer for 'site specific' traits to ..p for 'plot specific'. because s becomes a nightmare w. Nmass


*** logging before vs after community weighting ****
LMA is pretty different
LL is linear with a fair number of differences
Narea is totally the same
Nmnass is mostly the same with a handfull of bad ones.
  --> I've decided that I should log afterwards. so I will use log.cw_Traitp variables
# The key take homes: The story is pretty similar with dom 50%, dom 90% and communite weighted traits, though things do change qualitatively in some cases.

++dom 50% - old, LL and a little bit Nmass matter for RGR, nothing reall matters for stGrowth. Traits get ~15% of growth, ASA gets 60%

++dom 90% - have to log RGR, and LL and Nmass still jump out. But really not predictive (~15% of variation)
  - for stGrowth, everything has a significant relationship, but nothing is really predictive (r2 from .03-.1). 
  - for RGR, log(RGR), and stGrowth, traits explain <20% (LL is always important), while environment (primarily ASA) explains ~50%.

*** This also means I should probably rerun my taxonomic analysis averaging before logging...

*** climPCA is run on the freaking traits database, not the biomass database. practically, this means that I have to add it to biomass. But philosophically, I really should calculate it on biomass.
But this means I have to rerun EVERYTHING climate related...


####### New commit 06.16.17
Committed before I remake the trait-environment function to include ecoregion
- succeeded (I think) in adding ecoregion, and tracking it's variable importance (can't track it's effect sizes because spp have variable # of ecoregions)
- also added code to cacluate the best model for CW trait averages, and in general they're way more predictive than spp models! 
  - For some reason I get my shit rocked when trying to automate the CW bit, so I couldn't make it a function and you have to individually run each model selection in order for it to work.
- I also added in a function for doing the ensamble averaging without ECORGEION, because I need to rerun everything with scaled response variables or esle all the effect sizes are essentially meaningless.

** Note: I've also converted my date convention from mmddyy to yyymmdd so that files index if updated across years. I should try to keep this going for all my other projects, cause it's just better.


######## New commit 06.19.17
About to rerun all the trait-environment relationships and remake Fig 5 and Table 2 (which may get outsources) 
Also updating all trait-environmnet models without ECOREG becuase they didn't previously use scaled traits so effect sizes were hard to interpret.

-reran all the models, and w. and w.out ECOREGION for individual spp. (not for CW)
+updated the exported dataframes, but did not create an imps or avg for .ne models.
+initially exported everything as _20170619,
- but then added in CWmeans and exported as _20170619_v2

Notes from plotting: I think 2/3 page should do it, but I think I have to use boxplots rather than dotplots or else variable importances get almost impossible to interpret

+ added in CWmeans to the ttbest csvs and saved as _20170619_v2
